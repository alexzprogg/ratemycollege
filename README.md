# ratemycollege
A Flask-based web app that helps University of Toronto students **compare colleges** using both **structured ratings** (food, social life, study space, opportunities, clubs) and **NLP-derived themes** from student comments. The goal is to go beyond unstructured forum threads and provide **clean comparisons, trends over time, and semantic insights**.

> Built for UofT colleges first; architecture is generalizable to other schools.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Structured review funnel**: category checkboxes → short free-text → category ratings → auto-generated tags (users can edit/approve).
- **Dynamic averages & rankings**: compute real averages from real reviews (not hard-coded).
- **Trends & hashtags**: “Trending Right Now” on the homepage; top 3 hashtags per college.
- **Side-by-side comparisons**: visualize differences across colleges (e.g., food rating over time, tag distributions).
- **NLP pipeline**: extract themes/keywords, cluster topics, and weight recommendations by user intent.
- **Auth-gated contributions (✅ optional)**: login/registration before submitting reviews.
- **Data quality flags**: warn when a college has limited data (e.g., “Based on few reviews”).

### 4) Environment variables

Create a file named `.env` in the project root (this file should **not** be committed):

```dotenv

SECRET_KEY=change-me
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=sqlite:///instance/database.db
# Or, if your code expects a direct path instead of SQLAlchemy:
# DATABASE_PATH=instance/database.db
